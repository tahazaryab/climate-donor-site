          Climate Donor was founded on the belief that people would donate to
          climate change projects if they could see where their money was going.
          From vetting every project request to monitoring how project owners
          are fulfilling project objectives, financial transparency and
          accountability are our core values. We know you expect nothing less
          from us. Because of your trust, we together will make an impact in
          fighting climate change and species extinction.y
