Successful examples of coral reefs created by abandoned oil platforms exist on both east and west coasts of the US. While the below-surface rig structure provides an environmental benefit, the infrastructure above the sea level remains in place without any benefit. That’s where this Project comes in.  For those oil platforms that qualify, wind turbines can be installed on the unused platform surface and the electrical energy generated from these turbines could be stored via an electrolyte-based flow battery using the depleted oil reservoir for electrolyte storage.  The energy now stored in this flow battery can then converted back to electrical energy and sold when it is needed to meet consumer demand..."
